		<h4>Dear reader,</h4>
			<p>Bet you thought this would be a database! Jokes on you!</p>
			<p>In reality, I have been framed. The real villain here is <strong>Jamsheed Mistrivich</strong>.</p>
			<p>That's right. The famed hackathon organizer has actually stolen everyone's social security numbers! You should unfriend him on facebook.</p>
			<p>However, for reasons I cannot disclose here, I must take the fall for this mess. I won't go down without a fight, though!</p>
			<p>Once you sell me out, Jamsheed will know that you know his secret. He will not appreciate it. He will run. Do not lot him escape!</p>
			<p>I need you to prove that you can catch Mistrivich if it comes down to it. If you can do it with code, I believe you can do it physically.</p>
			<p>Outlined below is a simulation. If you can catch him, you earn the glory of exposing me!</p>
		<h4>Signed, Kyle Sandellovich</h4>

		<p>Jamsheed will run directly from his starting position to the exit. You are very smart and have predicted his trajectory to the exit, and need to intercept him before he escapes. Find the shortest trajectory you can travel from your starting position to intercept him.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Assume a 0-indexed 100x100 grid (that is, the top-left-most position is (0,0) and the bottom-right-most position is (99,99))</li>
			<li>Jamsheed's initial position is (23,42)</li>
			<li>Your initial position is (39,71)</li>
			<li>The exit's position is (88,88)</li>
			<li>You and Jamsheed can move left, right, up, or down</li>
			<li>Jamsheed's trajectory is {}</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Make sure to do it in a hipster language, too, for extra cool points.</p>
